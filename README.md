# Geoffles' Jenkins Theme
A fancy pants Jenkins theme.

I have some todos still, like Grunting out the build of the theme.

# Dependencies

This theme depends on the Jenkins [simple-theme-plugin]( https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Simple+Theme+Plugin ).

# Credits
Credit is due to:

-  [Jenkins Attlassian Theme](https://github.com/djonsson/jenkins-atlassian-theme)
-  [Jenkins Clean Theme](https://github.com/Dakota628/jenkins-clean-theme)

The icons come from the clean theme. The base of the styling comes from the Attlassion theme.
